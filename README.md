# NotChatBot-T3Next-Ecommerce
Mini ecommerce built with:

* React
* Next.js
* ShadcnUI
* Pnpm
* PostgreSQL (via Neon)
* Drizzle ORM
* Deployed on Vercel

The app displays products stored in a PostgreSQL database. It features a simple landing page showing a product, a cart, and a checkout flow.

Checkout dynamically updates the shipping cost based on the postal code entered, simulating real-world ecommerce behavior.

Optional features like free shipping over a certain amount are also considered.

Project scaffolded with Create T3 App.

Inspired by real ecommerce platforms like Shopify and Tiendanube.
